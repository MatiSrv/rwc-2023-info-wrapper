# Rugby World Cup 2023 Wrapper

## Description

The Rugby World Cup 2023 Wrapper is a Spring Boot project that serves as a wrapper for accessing information about the groups (pools) and results of the Rugby World Cup 2023 (RWC 2023). The project includes two controllers that allow users to retrieve data related to the tournament's group stage.

* Group Controller: Retrieve information about all groups and the results of matches played during the group stage.

* Specific Group Controller: Retrieve detailed results for a specific group during the group stage.

The project uses a REST client to connect to external APIs. One API provides information about the participating teams in the World Cup, while another API provides details about the matches played during the group stage. The wrapper processes this information to present it in a more user-friendly format.


## Technologies
* Java Spring Boot
* JUnit and Mockito for testing
* Deployment: Docker
